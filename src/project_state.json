  "summary": "A React + TypeScript single-page \"Valentine's\" microsite with a follower-facing \"wishlink\" tool: users can generate/share a clean, mobile-compatible link that personalizes the site by swapping the displayed girlfriend/crush name (default: \"Radhika\") while keeping all other visuals and behaviors unchanged, and includes a main-page CTA link labeled \"make your own 💗\" that redirects to the tool page.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend is a Vite-style React SPA (ReactDOM.createRoot) using TypeScript and component-level local state (no backend queries required for the main UX).",
    "Styling uses TailwindCSS with OKLCH-based CSS variables and dark mode via the `class` strategy; custom keyframes/utilities drive animations (float, heartbeat, glow, scale-in, shimmer, emoji bounce).",
    "Animations are implemented as fixed-position overlay components (FloatingHearts, CelebrationHearts, SmilingEmojiAnimation) layered via z-index and `pointer-events: none`.",
    "Interactive UI behavior is encapsulated in `ValentineCard` using refs + DOM measurements to reposition the \"No\" button within container bounds.",
    "Authentication is implemented as a React Context provider (`InternetIdentityProvider`) wrapping the app; it uses `@dfinity/auth-client` and ICP SDK identities, with delegation validity checks.",
    "Canister actor instantiation is wrapped by a `useActor` hook using `@tanstack/react-query` caching keyed by principal, with global invalidation/refetch of dependent queries when identity/actor changes.",
    "Backend code is Motoko with a modular design: a `Storage` module for state/authorization/cycle top-up utilities and a `Mixin` providing shared/query methods intended to be mixed into a canister.",
    "Runtime configuration was centralized via a dedicated frontend config module (e.g., `frontend/src/config.ts`) rather than ad-hoc environment access in hooks.",
    "A `build-template/` scaffold was added to support reproducible packaging/deployment (ICP canister YAML, deploy scripts, and a preconfigured shadcn/ui-based frontend template).",
    "Frontend now includes generated/typed backend canister declarations (`declarations/*.did.*`) and a small `StorageClient` helper to encapsulate blob-storage interactions via the actor hook."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Two different `index.css` files exist (`frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/index.css`) with different variable sets; depending on build configuration this may cause confusion or unused/incorrect styling if the wrong file is bundled.",
    "Tool route is not opening: navigating to the intended Create Link page (e.g., `/#/tool` or `/tool`) redirects back to the main Valentine front page, indicating a routing configuration/route registration issue (hash vs browser routing or missing route).",
    "Confirmed in production that navigating to the tool hash route still redirects to the front page (example failing URL: https://hass-matt-pagli-pyaar-ho-jayega-ag-cdv.caffeine.xyz/#/tool), indicating the router/hosting still isn’t serving or recognizing the /#/tool route as intended.",
    "After deploying v26, the Create Link (/ #/tool) page still does not load for the user (tool route issue persists)."
