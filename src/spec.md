  - Moves away smoothly and randomly to a new position when hovered or clicked
  - Changes position dynamically upon each hover/click attempt within the centered container
  - Cycles through funny text messages in sequence: "Really?", "You Sure?", "No Escape!", "You can't escape love 💘", "Love always wins 💕", "Keep trying 🤭", "Seriously? 🤨", "Still no? Really? 😂", "Nope, not happening 🙅", "Try again!" then repeats
